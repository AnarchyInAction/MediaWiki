AnarchyinAction.org is a resource for anyone to research and write about how and when anarchy can work. '''''Anarchy''''', coming from the Greek words ''an'' (without) and ''archos'' (ruler) refers to a situation without domination, without coercive hierarchy. Here are many examples of anarchy in practice. By looking for anarchy well beyond the self-proclaimed anarchist movements (although we're interested in those too!), we respond, for example, to Maia Ramnath's call in ''Decolonizing Anarchism'' to "locate the Western anarchist tradition as one contextually specific manifestation among a larger-indeed global-tradition of antiauthoritarian, egal­itarian thought/praxis".<ref>Maia Ramnath, ''Decolonizing Anarchism: An Antiauthoritarian History of India's Liberation Struggle'' (AK Press, 2011), 6.</ref> We take our name from Colin Ward's 1973 book ''[[Anarchy in Action]]''.

''"Once we leave Europe, in fact, we discover that statelessness and the desire for self-government are not eternally receding utopias, but are principles that for millennia have structured communities in every part of the world."'' -Silvia Federici<ref> Silvia Federici, "Global Anarchism: Provocations" in ''No Gods, No Masters, No Peripheries: Global Anarchisms'', ed.

=Nonhuman Anarchy=

''"Everything is connected, absolutely everything. There are many aboriginal groups that will tell you stories about how all the species in the forests are connected, and many will talk about below-ground networks."'' -Sm’hayetsk Teresa Ryan<ref>Ferris Jabr, "The Social Life of Forests", ''New York Times'', 2 December, 2020, https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/02/magazine/tree-communication-mycorrhiza.html.</ref>

''"The basic premise in the ontology of wildness translates into anarchy, where the'' raison d'etre ''of everything and everyone - living or non-living, human or nonhuman, child or adult, male, female, intersexual, bisexual, or asexual, whatever the species, ethnicity, or race (all of which are important classifications for civilization only) is simply to be and to enjoy being. In wilderness, the world exists for its own reasons, its space and time uncontrolled, solely its own, regardless of whether it was created by an external divine will or generated through its own exploded forces."'' - Layla AbdelRahim<ref>Layla AbdelRahim, ''Children's Literature, Domestication, and Social Foundation'' (New York: Routledge, 2015), 3-4.</ref>

''"As I watch the Robins and Cedar Waxwings fill their bellies, I see a gift economy in which abundance is stored “in the belly of my brother.” Supporting a thriving bird community is essential to the well-being of the Serviceberry and everyone else up the food chain. That seems especially important to an immobile, long-lived being like a tree, who can’t run away from ruptured relationships. Thriving is possible only if you have nurtured strong bonds with your community."''-Robin Wall Kimmerer<ref>Robin Wall Kimmerer, "The Serviceberry: An Economy of Abundance," ''Emergence Magazine'', 2020, https://emergencemagazine.org/story/the-serviceberry/.</ref>

''" From autocatalytic chemical processes to cells, from living bodies to galaxies, we find a universe filled with structures exhibiting self-organizing dynamics... [A]n atom is a self-organizing system as well. Each atom is a storm of ordered activity. This invisible power assembling the energy into a particular constellation is the atom's identity. A galaxy, too, is an autopoietic system, organizing its stars into a nonequilibrium process and drawing forth new stars from its interstellar materials."'' -Brian Swimme and Thomas Berry <ref>Brian Swimme and Thomas Berry, ''The Universe Story: From the Primordial Flaring Forth to the Ecozoic Era - A Celebration of the Unfolding of the Cosmos'' (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1992), 75.</ref>

''"The forest has always been my teacher in peace, in diversity in democracy. Diverse life forms, small and large, moving and immobile, above ground and below, with wings, feet or leaves, find their place in the forest. The forest teaches us that in diversity lie the conditions of peace, the realization of democracy."'' -Vandana Shiva<ref>Vandana Shiva, "Foreword" in Derrick Jensen and George Draffan, ''Strangely Like War: The Global Assault on Forests'' (White River Junction: Chelsea Green Publishing Company, 2003), vii.</ref>

''"If we recognize that every ecosystem can also be viewed as a food web, we can think of it as a circular, interlacing nexus of plant-animal relationships (rather than a stratified pyramid)...Each species, be it a form of bacteria or deer, is knitted together in a network of interdependence. A predator in the web is also prey, even if the 'lowliest' of organisms merely makes it ill or helps to consume it after death."'' -Murray Bookchin<ref>Murray Bookchin, ''The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy'' (Palo Alto: Cheshire Books, 1982), 26.</ref>
