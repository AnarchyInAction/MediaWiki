What began as [[Wikipedia:Free_and_Open_Source_Software|FOSS]] recommendations, but has grown beyond software into hardware and general advice.'''
</center>

= Avoid PRISM & Other Surveillance =
[[Image:Wesnoth.svg|64px|left]]
* The U.S. [[Wikipedia:PRISM|PRISM Surveillance program]] has now been laid bare, and we should all be worried about it.  Many of the recommendations below provide relief from surveillance or at least some level of protection.  For a nice graphical list of alternatives to avoid PRISM, see [http://prism-break.org PRISM Break] and [https://alternatives.tacticaltech.org Tactical Tech].
* Check out our [[Libre_Recommendations#Privacy & Anonymity|recommendations for Privacy and Anonymity]]
* For more detailed guides to self-defense, see the [https://ssd.eff.org/ SSD Project] and [[Libre_Recommendations#Riseup.net|Riseup.net]]'s [https://help.riseup.net/en/security primer on security].

=Social Media Alternatives=

== [[File:Mastodon_logo.png|64px|left]] Federated Social networks ==
* [https://kolektiva.social Kolektiva] is a leftist friendly [https://joinmastodon.org Mastodon] instance.<br>
* [https://www.farcaster.xyz/ Farcaster] is a sufficiently decentralized social network built on Ethereum. $5 yearly fee. <br>
* [https://kolektiva.media/videos/local kolektiva.media] collective offering video hosting to anarchist collectives and individuals<br>
* [https://social.edist.ro social.edist.ro] anarchists and antifascists everywhere <br>
* [https://friendi.ca/ Friendica] is software to create a distributed social network. Diaspora and Hubzilla compatible .

==[[Image:Panquake-logo-W.png|64px|left]] [https://panquake.com/ PanQuake] ==
* [https://panquake.com/5000/ Join our BETA] for Powerful, next generation messaging technology.
* Custom Blockchain, SMS support, Transparent moderation, and no timeline manipulation.
* No selling user data, advertising free, fee based.

= Free Software =
==[[File:Openlogo-debianV2.svg|64px|left]] Definition ==
* '''These programs fit the [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html free software definition] ([[Wikipedia:Free_software|libre]]) and are also [[Wikipedia:Freeware|freeware]] ([[Wikipedia:Gratis_versus_libre|gratis]]).'''
* These programs fit the [http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines Debian Free Software Guidelines].
* You may see the acronym FOSS, meaning "free/open-source software".

== Operating Systems ==
===[[Image:Gnulinux.svg|64px|left]] General ===
* It's not just a Windows and Mac world.  '''Mac vs. PC is a marketing illusion''', and [http://www.defectivebydesign.org/apple Apple doesn't respect our freedom].
* Many of the programs listed below are developed on [[Wikipedia:GNU_Linux|GNU/Linux]], and then [[Wikipedia:Porting|ported]] to Windows.  As such, they're likely to work better on GNU/Linux.  See the [[Free_Skool:Software#GNU.2FLinux|GNU/Linux options]] below if you'd like to try out a new and exciting operating system, and get out of the Mac vs. PC rut.
* Due to a malfunction in [[User:Diggity|Diggity]]'s reality distortion field, most of the individual apps listed below are for Windows.  That [http://en.windows7sins.org awful proprietary OS] is still widely installed, so it can be a starting point for FOSS users.
* Suggestions for Mac OSX programs are welcome, and this list will also grow to include phone/tablet platforms.
* Suggestions for software without Windows or Mac builds should have an accompanying note.  GNU/Linux users generally don't need to search around the Web and download individual packages/tarballs/binaries, since modern distributions have [[Wikipedia:Package_management_system|package management systems]].

* Other alternatives include [http://linuxmint.com Linux Mint], [http://lxle.net LXLE], [http://xubuntu.org Xubuntu], [http://ubuntu.com Ubuntu], [http://opensuse.org OpenSuSE], and [http://chakra-project.org Chakra].  These operating systems have a mix of libre and proprietary code, or other problems (e.g. Ubuntu's "lenses" send data to companies like Amazon).
* You don't have to be tied to your OS and should instead look at the [http://distrowatch.org huge variety of alternatives].
* More help installing/configuring a [[Wikipedia:List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian-based|Debian-based]] or [[Wikipedia:List_of_Linux_distributions#Ubuntu-based|Ubuntu-based]] system (like [http://trisquel.info Trisquel] and [http://parsix.org Parsix]):
